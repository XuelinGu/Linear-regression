#Fitting Linear Regression Model

**Linearregression** package is used for fitting linear fitting linear regression models with numeric or categorical covariates.

Compared with commonly used *lm()* in package **stats**, the main function *lr()* in **Linearregression** package is more efficient with same accuracy since we used matrix operation function in Rcpp.

The goal of this tutorial is to give a general introduction to **Linearregression** package. It will help to know how to use *lr()* this package and its performance from following aspects:

- Item 1[^1]
- Item 2[^2]
- Item 3[^2]
---------

```{r setup}
library(Linearregression)
```

##[^1]; Data preparing
Firstly, *lr()* is used for estimating the  
```{r run}

```
